# Two-in-One
This version merge 4.1 and 4.2 into one version, so the code will
be easier for coding.

# 4.1 version.
The 4.1 version is just a simple test.
So you don't have to worry about that.

# 4.2 version
Featuring Girl tell you how to make your
own game.

```py
## For example, dialogue:
## 4.0 version:
Text(text_list, pos, surface)
##  The 4.1 version:
ui.text(line1, pos, surface)
ui.say(string, pos, surface, color)
##  The 4.1 version:
name = Sayer("name", color="who_color")
ui.text(line1, pos, surface)
ui.say(character_object)
```

# Updated.
At least, I fixed a problem in the old version, I acidentally
found out while checking my PC. That's clicking error.
Sorry, everyone.
