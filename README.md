# Huge updated!

Added idle and hover image for choice and now 
it position will always at center.

Move frame.png to script/display and remove
it in images dict, replaced by using 
pygame.image.load().

Move the demo to demo/ directory, and outside
it, there's a make.py.

# Make template

Go to command line, then type:

```console
$ python make.py 
```

A new directory named template will be added, 
rename it then test.

(It will copy file that needed from original demo,
and write script.py. If you miragate your game from
old version, rename it to template then run make.py, 
remember to backup your game in a folder, drop your
script.py to the new template/game/ directory.)
