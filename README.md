# Huge update

Now we have a launcher window, just choose which
game in the options and choose it to launch the
game (using subprocess with shell=True).

The script folder has been moved to the launcher
base, the game has been launched using code from
script/ folder in the base instead.

(I just noticed the 800x600 pygame window appear
with 'MoviePy' title and filled with black color
and closed after opened in pyinstaller command.)

After replaced the file, I also made a new feature.

# bug report
