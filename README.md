# Huge update

Now we have a launcher window, just choose which
game in the options and choose it to launch the
game (using subprocess with shell=True).

The script folder has been moved to the launcher
base, the game has been launched using code from
script/ folder in the base instead.

(I just noticed the 800x600 pygame window appear
with 'MoviePy' title and filled with black color
and closed after opened in pyinstaller command.)
