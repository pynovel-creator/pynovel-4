# Two-in-One
This version merge 4.1 and 4.2 into one version, so the code will
be easier for coding.

```py
## For example, dialogue:
## 4.0 version:
Text(text_list, pos, surface)
##  This one:
ui.text(line1, pos, surface)
ui.say(string, pos, surface, color)
```

# Updated.
At least, I fixed a problem in the old version, I acidentally
found out while checking my PC. That's clicking error.
Sorry, everyone.

# Bug report

creator/pynovel-4/issues. I will fix it soon.
